### What is Pyroscope
[Pyroscope](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope) is a tool that lets you continuously profile your applications to prevent and debug performance issues in your code. It consists of a low-overhead agent which sends data to the Pyroscope server which includes a custom-built storage engine. This allows for you to store and query any applications profiling data in an extremely efficient and cost effective way.

### Profiling Ruby applications

Add the `pyroscope` gem to your Gemfile:

```bash
bundle add pyroscope
```

### Basic Configuration

Add the following code to your application. If you're using rails, put this into `config/initializers` directory. This code will initialize pyroscope profiler and start profiling:

```ruby
require 'pyroscope'

Pyroscope.configure do |config|
  config.application_name = "my.ruby.app" # replace this with some name for your application
  config.server_address   = "http://my-pyroscope-server:4040" # replace this with the address of your pyroscope server
  # config.auth_token     = "{YOUR_API_KEY}" # optionally, if authentication is enabled, specify the API key
end
```

### Tags

Pyroscope ruby integration provides a number of ways to tag profiling data. For example, you can provide tags when you're initializing the profiler:

```ruby
require 'pyroscope'

Pyroscope.configure do |config|
  config.application_name = "my.ruby.app"
  config.server_address   = "http://my-pyroscope-server:4040"

  config.tags = {
    "hostname" => ENV["HOSTNAME"],
  }
end
```

or you can dynamically tag certain parts of your code:

```ruby
Pyroscope.tag_wrapper({ "controller": "slow_controller_i_want_to_profile" }) do
  slow_code
end
```

### Example
